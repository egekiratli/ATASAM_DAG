# ATASAM_DAG

These Jupyter notebooks contains what I've learned computation-wise during my internship at ATASAM (Atat√ºrk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center) & DAG (Eastern Anatolia Observatory).

My main motivation was was to learn certain graphs (color-magnitude, color-color) that are often used in astrophysics, model and fit the data, and handle FITS files in order to get a grasp of the basics of computational astrophysics.

Note: Notebooks contains some gaps and errors due to my limited time at ATASAM. I will try to update the notebooks so that the future interns would have a guide on basics.
