# ATASAM_DAG

These Jupyter notebooks contains what I've learned computation-wise during my internship at ATASAM (Atatürk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center) & DAG (Eastern Anatolia Observatory).

My main motivation was was to learn certain graphs (color-magnitude, color-color) that are often used in astrophysics, model and fit the data, and handle FITS files in order to get a grasp of the basics of computational astrophysics.

Note: Notebooks contains some gaps and errors due to my limited time at ATASAM. I will try to update the notebooks so that the future interns would have a guide on basics.

Note2: I've also studied compact blue stars (AM CVn systems), following the PhD thesis of my advisor, Onur ŞATIR, trying to follow his steps during his research to understand the behavior and the nature of these systems while also learning how to classify the observational data through color selection.
