ATASAM & DAG Internship Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks document my learning journey during my internship at ATASAM (Atat√ºrk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center) and the Eastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG).
My main focus was to understand essential tools in computational astrophysics, including:

Creating color-magnitude and color-color diagrams

Handling and analyzing FITS files

Modeling and fitting astrophysical data

I also explored compact blue stars (AM CVn systems), guided by the PhD thesis of my advisor, Onur ≈ûATIR, aiming to grasp their behavior and nature through color selection and classification.

‚ö†Ô∏è Some notebooks may contain gaps or minor errors due to time constraints, but I plan to update them regularly to serve as a guide for future interns.

üîç Star Classification Framework
A new notebook demonstrating a Random Forest-based framework for star classification using color indices has been added.
This framework is in its early stage and will be improved and expanded over time.
