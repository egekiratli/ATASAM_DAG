ATASAM & DAG Internship Notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks document my learning journey during my internship at ATASAM (Atatürk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center) and the Eastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG).
My main focus was to understand essential tools in computational astrophysics, including:

- Creating color-magnitude and color-color diagrams

- Handling and analyzing FITS files

- Modeling and fitting astrophysical data

I also explored compact blue stars (AM CVn systems), guided by the PhD thesis of my advisor, Onur ŞATIR, aiming to grasp their behavior and nature through color selection and classification.

> ⚠️ Some notebooks may contain gaps or minor errors due to time constraints, but I plan to update them regularly to serve as a guide for future interns.

🔍 Star Classification Framework:

A new notebook demonstrating a Random Forest-based framework for star classification using color indices has been added (06/2025).
This framework is in its early stage and will be improved and expanded over time.
